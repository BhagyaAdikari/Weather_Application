## Introduction
This Weather Application is a cross-platform application built with C#. It fetches real-time weather data based on the user's current location and displays details such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a general weather description. The app provides an intuitive user interface and integrates with a weather API to offer accurate and up-to-date weather information.

## API Details
This application integrates with a third-party weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap). Below are the key details:
- **Base URL**: `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather`
- **API Key**: Replace `<Your-API-Key>` in `ApiService.cs` with your key.
- **Endpoints Used**:
  - Weather data by geographic coordinates.

---

## Troubleshooting
- **NullReferenceException**: Ensure all variables like `WeatherList` are initialized before use.
- **Location Access Denied**: Check if the app has location permissions enabled.
- **API Key Error**: Confirm that your API key is valid and correctly placed in the `ApiService.cs` file.
- **Build Issues**: Restore NuGet packages and ensure all dependencies are installed.

---

## Future Enhancements
- Add support for searching weather data by city name.
- Implement a forecast feature to display weather for the next few days.
- Improve UI/UX with custom themes and animations.
- Add offline support by caching the last retrieved weather data.
- Localize the application to support multiple languages.
